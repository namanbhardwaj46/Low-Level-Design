# Design Patterns and SOLID Principles

This repository contains implementations of SOLID principles and common Design Patterns with example use cases.

Reference: [Design Patterns Catalog](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

## SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle  
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns
Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones

### 2. Structural Patterns
Patterns that focus on object composition and relationships between objects.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem


### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Patterns that focus on communication between objects and responsibilities.

- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
