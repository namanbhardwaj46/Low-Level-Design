# Builder Pattern Implementation for Building Queries

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a database management system that involves creating and executing SQL queries. Queries can vary in complexity, involving different SELECT clauses, JOIN operations, WHERE conditions, and more. The current approach of constructing queries using concatenated strings has proven to be error-prone, difficult to read, and challenging to modify. You should implement the Builder pattern to create instances of query objects with various configurations, resulting in more maintainable and flexible code.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to construct query objects with different configurations. The Builder pattern facilitates the step-by-step construction of complex objects while keeping the creation process separate from the main object.

The usage of your builder should look like this:

```python
query = QueryBuilder()\
    .with_select('name', 'age')\
    .with_from('users')\
    .with_where('age > 18')\
    .build()
```

## Implementing the Builder Pattern

1. `Review the original class and the builder interface` - You have been provided with a class that represents the query data `Query`. The class has a number of properties that are used to create the query object. The class extends from the `Builder` interface which has a method `build()` that returns an instance of the class. Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to create instances of a class with the same properties. You have to complete the implementation of the `build` method.

2. `Implement the setter methods` - The idea of the builder method to have a mutable instance of the `Query` class in the builder class and expose methods to set the properties of the class. Once the properties have been set, the `build` method is called to create an immutable instance of the class. You need to implement the setter methods for the properties of the `Query` class in the builder class. Methods like `with_select`, `with_from`, `with_where`, etc. should be implemented so that the user can use the builder instance to set the properties of the `Query` class.

3. `Implement the build method` - The `build` method is responsible for creating an instance of the `Query` class. The method should return an instance of the `Query` class with the properties set by the user using the builder instance.

4. `Test your implementation` - A test case has been provided for you to test your implementation. Run the test case to ensure that your implementation is correct.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Query` class and implement the setter methods in the `QueryBuilder` class.
3. Implement the `build` method in the `QueryBuilder` class.
4. Run the provided test cases in the `TestQueryBuilder` class to verify the correctness of your implementation.
