# Class Notes: Pizza Shop Software Implementation

In this class, we delved into several important software engineering concepts, particularly focusing on design patterns like the Decorator Design Pattern, and the concepts of association, aggregation, and composition within object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Overview

The main focus of the class was implementing a pizza shop system using the Decorator Design Pattern. This pattern allows for adding functionality to objects dynamically, which is essential for scenarios like a pizza shop where customers can add various toppings to their pizzas.

## Decorator Design Pattern

1. Basic Concept: The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

2. Application in Pizza Shop:

    * Base Pizza Class: We begin with a Pizza abstract class that has a getPrice method.
    * Concrete Implementations: A BasePizza class inherits from Pizza and implements the getPrice method, returning a base price.
    * Add-ons as Decorators:

        * Classes like Cheese and Mushroom are created, each implementing the getPrice method that adds their own price on top of the pizza's price.
        * These add-ons are decorators since they enhance the functionality of the base pizza by incorporating additional costs dynamically.

3. Implementation Details:

    * It's essential to have a base pizza before adding any toppings or decorations【4:5†source】.
    * Each decorator has an association with a pizza, and it requires a pizza instance to calculate its full price【4:7†source】.
    * This setup allows the system to be adaptable and maintainable, so if the price of a component changes, only that specific class needs modification, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)【4:19†source】.

## Object-Oriented Concepts

Association, Aggregation, and Composition

1. Association:

    * It is a relationship where all objects have their lifecycle, and there is no owner. In the context of our pizza system, the Cheese and Mushroom classes are associated with Pizza.
    * Example: A Pizza class having instances of various Topping or Addon classes.

2. Aggregation:

    * It is a specialized form of association with a loose relationship and is often described as a "has-a" relationship. For instance, Pizza "has" toppings, but these toppings can exist independently.
    * Example: An aggregation can be having a Basket class containing multiple Fruit objects where the fruits can exist independently of the basket【4:17†source】.

3. Composition:

    * It is a strong form of association with strict dependency (if the parent object is deleted, so is the child), seen as part-whole relationship. In the pizza example, the pizza cannot exist without its base component.
    * The Cheese and Mushroom decorators show composition since they need a Pizza object to function, implying strong lifecycle dependency【4:17†source】.

## UML Diagrams

    * Class Diagrams:
        * Class diagrams were used to depict the relationships and hierarchies within the system, showing classes like Pizza, BasePizza, Cheese, and Mushroom.
        * Attributes of classes, visibility (public/private), and methods (like getPrice) are detailed within these diagrams【4:16†source】.

## Conclusion

The workshop provided an insightful application of theoretical concepts into practical design patterns that solve real-world problems in software development by demonstrating a solution for managing and extending features without altering existing code structures significantly. This enhances the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the system.
